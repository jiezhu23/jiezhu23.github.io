# About me

Welcome! I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://engineering.msu.edu/about/departments/cse) at [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/), advised by [Dr. Xiaoming Liu](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~liuxm/index2.html). I also collaborate closely with [Dr. Anil Jain](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~jain/). 

My research interests span multimodal learning and biometrics. In particular, I work on:  
- **Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)** and **Reinforcement Post-training** ([Paper](https://jiezhu23.github.io/files/Papers/ReFineRFT_Jie.pdf))
- **Multimodal Biometrics** ([ICCV25 Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00053), [TPAMI under review](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.04616)) 
- **Visual Question Answering (VQA)** ([MM23 Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.02290)) and broader visual understanding.

Prior to MSU, I received my M.S. in Computer Science from [George Washington University](https://graduate.engineering.gwu.edu/) in 2023, and my B.S. in Computer Science from [Northeastern University](https://english.neu.edu.cn/) (Shenyang, China) in 2020. During working in [Research of Institute of Tsinghua, Pearl River Delta](http://www.tsinghua-gd.org/), I have filed 14 Chinese patents, of which 10 have been granted.

# Beyond Research
Life is more than just research. I have diverse interests such as photography, cooking, sports like badminton and snowboarding, and music including the saxophone, flute, and Guzheng (a traditional Chinese instrument).
